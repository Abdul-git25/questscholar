### 2.2.1 Langerhans cell histiocytosis

**Authors:** Carlos Rodríguez‐Galindo, Carl E. Allen (2020)  
**Source:** Blood  
**Quality Score:** 5.00/5.0

Abstract Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is caused by clonal expansion of myeloid precursors that differentiate into CD1a+/CD207+ cells in lesions that leads to a spectrum of organ involvement and dysfunction. The pathogenic cells are defined by constitutive activation of the MAPK signaling pathway. Treatment of LCH is risk-adapted: patients with single lesions may respond well to local treatm...

**Authors:** Gaurav Goyal, Abdellatif Tazi, Ronald S. Go et al. (2022)  
**Source:** Blood  
**Quality Score:** 5.00/5.0

Abstract Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) can affect children and adults with a wide variety of clinical manifestations, including unifocal, single-system multifocal, single-system pulmonary (smoking-associated), or multisystem disease. The existing paradigms in the management of LCH in adults are mostly derived from the pediatric literature. Over the last decade, the discovery of clonality and...

**Source:** American Journal of Hematology  
**Quality Score:** 4.70/5.0

Abstract Adult Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) remains poorly defined. We retrospectively studied 266 newly diagnosed LCH patients to understand the clinical presentation, treatment, and prognosis of adult LCH. The median age at diagnosis was 32 years (range, 18-79 years). At the time of diagnosis, 40 patients had single lesions within a single system, 18 patients had single pulmonary LCH, 26 ...

**Quality Score:** 4.40/5.0

Abstract Children with Langerhnans cell histiocytosis (LCH) develop granulomatous lesions with characteristic clonal CD207+ dendritic cells that can arise as single lesions or life-threatening disseminated disease. Despite the wide range of clinical presentations, LCH lesions are histologically indistinguishable based on severity of disease, and uncertain classification as an immune versus neoplas...

*Assessment: A recent, well-cited (75 citations) review that provides a valuable update on the molecular pathogenesis and classification of LCH.*

**Authors:** Carlos Rodríguez‐Galindo (2021)  
**Source:** Acta Paediatrica  
**Quality Score:** 4.10/5.0

Abstract Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is caused by the expansion of CD1a+/CD207+ cells and is characterised by a wide spectrum of organ involvement and dysfunction, affecting all ages. While almost all organs and systems can be affected, only the involvement and dysfunction of liver, spleen, and haematopoietic system influence survival. The LCH pathogenic cells are defined by universal acti...

Abstract Pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis (PLCH) is a diffuse cystic lung disease that is strongly associated with exposure to cigarette smoke. Recently, activating pathogenic mutations in the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway have been described in the dendritic cells in patients with PLCH and have firmly established PLCH to be an inflammatory myeloid neoplasm. Disease course and pr...
